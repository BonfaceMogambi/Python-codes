📌 My Python Learning Journey
Welcome to my Python learning journey!
This repository contains the Python codes I’ve written as I learn and grow in programming. Each file represents a lesson, challenge, or real-world problem I’ve solved using Python.

🚀 About This Repository
This repo is a collection of my Python practice projects, including:
  1. Web scraping
  2. API automation
  3. Data analysis using pandas
  4. Desktop automation
  5. Task scheduling
  6. Database interactions
  7. Real-time monitoring dashboards

Every script is a milestone in my learning path — from beginner concepts to more advanced applications.
This journey has helped me build skills in:

✅ Python Basics
Variables, loops, functions, conditionals, error handling
✅ Web Scraping & Automation
BeautifulSoup, Requests, Selenium, automation logic
✅ Data Handling
Pandas, CSV/Excel operations, data cleaning
✅ APIs & Requests
GET/POST requests, authentication, JSON handling
✅ Database Interaction
MySQL, PostgreSQL (planned), SQLite
✅ Dashboards & Monitoring
Streamlit dashboards, real-time data visualization

🛠️ Key Projects (Examples)
🔹 1. Web Scraping Project
Scrapes data from websites using BeautifulSoup
Handles pagination and export to Excel

🔹 2. API Automation
Automates API requests
Uses Python requests module
Handles authentication and response parsing

🔹 3. Dashboard Monitoring
Streamlit dashboards
Real-time data updates
Visual charts and reports

🔹 4. POS System (In Progress)
Point of Sale system
Inventory tracking
Sales reports
User login system

📌 How to Run
Run the script
python script_name.py

📌 Future Goals
I plan to build more projects including:
Advanced dashboards
Full POS system
Machine learning projects
Automation bots
Web apps with Flask or Django

🙌 Thank You!

Thanks for checking out my Python journey.
I’m excited to keep learning and building more projects!
