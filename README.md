📌 My Python Learning Journey
Welcome to my Python learning journey!
This repository contains the Python codes I’ve written as I learn and grow in programming. Each file represents a lesson, challenge, or real-world problem I’ve solved using Python.

🚀 About This Repository
This repo is a collection of my Python practice projects, including:

Web scraping

API automation

Data analysis using pandas

Desktop automation

Task scheduling

Database interactions

Real-time monitoring dashboards

And more…

Every script is a milestone in my learning path — from beginner concepts to more advanced applications.

🧠 What I’m Learning

This journey has helped me build skills in:

✅ Python Basics
Variables, loops, functions, conditionals, error handling

✅ Web Scraping & Automation
BeautifulSoup, Requests, Selenium, automation logic

✅ Data Handling
Pandas, CSV/Excel operations, data cleaning

✅ APIs & Requests
GET/POST requests, authentication, JSON handling

✅ Database Interaction
MySQL, PostgreSQL (planned), SQLite

✅ Dashboards & Monitoring
Streamlit dashboards, real-time data visualization
